  ## Description

  This project is a mock blog site created to manage data. As usual, we have to implement CRUD functionality to create, read, update and delete blogposts. Users are able to log in or sign up for an account, allowing them to create and view details on blogposts and comments. Users who are not logged in will not be able to perform these functions. 

  Notice: this is still a work in progress, so some of the functions mentioned above are not yet available.

  This application requires the user to have Node.js downloaded onto their system. It is recommended that the user downloads v16 up to v18 for this application to run properly. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v16.16.0).

  MySQL is also required for this app to run properly. Follow this step-by-step [guide](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mysql/mysql-installation-guide) to make sure everything is downloaded smoothly.

  After opening up this app, make sure to type these into the integrated terminal and install these required npm packages/dependencies: 
  - `npm i express` is required to build the server.

  - `npm i sequelize` is the tool used for ORM.
  - `npm i bcrypt` is needed for password hashing.
